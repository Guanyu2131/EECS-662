## Instructor
Dr. Perry Alexander

## Course Description
Programming Languages is an introduction to basic principles of defining, describing and implementing interpreters for programming languages. The fundamental goal is establishing a vocabulary for discussing what programming languages and programs written in them do. Topics covered to accomplish this are data representation and types; declarations, bindings and variable assignment; parameter passing and function evaluation; statements; and objects and types; The course uses an implementation-based approach with students developing type checkers, interpreters for languages that demonstrate features presented in class.
